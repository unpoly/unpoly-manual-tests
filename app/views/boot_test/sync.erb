<h1>Booting (sync scripts)</h1>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Both Unpoly and user script have loaded synchronously (blocking the DOM parser).</li>
  <li>The user script took intentionally long to render.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Unpoly has booted automatically after the user script was called.</li>
  <li>The background should be red (from a user script compiler).</li>
</ul>
